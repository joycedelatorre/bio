				Hello! I am Joyce De La Torre. I am born and raised in the Philippines. I graduated Nursing but then I moved to California. After working for several years as a nurse and teacher I got married and moved to Austin Texas for good. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to change careers and found codecademy as my starting point in coding. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and javascript.
